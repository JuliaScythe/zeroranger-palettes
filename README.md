## Installation

- Ensure you have the [ResourceManager](https://juliascythe.net/2024/10/04/resource-manager.html) mod, version **>= 1.3** installed
- Clone or download this repo to a `palettes` folder inside your ZeroRanger directory (so that the `.zrpal` files are directly in the `palettes` folder.)
- Select the palettes from the standard in-game menu! *(Note: You'll have to beat the game at least once to have access to the palettes menu.)*

## Credits
